## Starting a Personal Blog

As I start my day, I find myself realizing that I completely forgot and neglected this blog. With that realization, I have to give it a purpose and meaning as to why I am utilizing it. The goal being to help me become a better writer and work on bettering my communication skills in order to help give myself the needed courage to reach out to the communities here on Github and other platforms to help me learn how to work collaborately with others.

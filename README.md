I plan on utilizing this blog as an opportunity to keep track of my personal developer and development goals as I move forward into the comng year. I have a lot of work to do in order for me to catch up with all the other programmers and developers out there. As I still strive to be a Web Developer, I have to still learn a lot of different languages alongside the tools necessary to build the applications and solutions that I strive to build toward.

I am also learning how to better manage my current repositories and utilize them toward a purpose driven by the pursuit of knowledge and sharing my results to whomever comes across my repositories. I am aiming to build better quality content, software, hardware, and solid knowledge base in which I can look back upon and realize how far I actually came from where I once started and still begin. 

This journey will be taking me across all sorts of different fields, subjects and I look forward to documenting the entire process by utilizing this blog as a medium to doing so.

## Goals 
The goal currently is to become more familiarized with the constraints that I currently have utilizing this Jekyll theme. It didn't come with a README and I don't recall where I got this theme from. It was apparently made in 2015 and a lot has changed since then in the world of technology. I plan on making small improvements to further flush out the potential of this Jekyll Theme and see what I can do to better optimize it. 

Another goal is to establish a daily routine of creating content for this blog, and not becoming overwhelmed in the process. I plan to utilize this blog as a means of keeping track of issues and problems that I experience with all my platforms and tools that I utilize to build and create my software. I will also be looking into how to implement CI/CD Pipelines to insure that the site is well maintained and properly updated.
